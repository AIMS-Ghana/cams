~Challenge students to modify interface.
~Evaluate efficiency and quality of interfaces of common software
~Emphasize importance of usability, robustness
Have students exchange long project code and modify each other's code to produce output in various programs (i.e. Excel-like spreadsheet, databases, LaTex), and interface with various libraries, databases provided.
