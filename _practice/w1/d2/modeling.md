##Interview us to compete/submit bid for one of the following

1. We are owners of soccer teams, want to optimize ticket pricing
  1. Use previous data: how priced, date, weather, opponent
1. We are managers for a soccer team (find best fantasy team)
  1. Use individual stats [here](http://www.whoscored.com/Statistics)
2. We own sports news websites, want to rank teams based on some metric.  Include team stats. Include individual stats?
3. We own a stadium, want to know how to optimize revenue with advertisements
  1. Consider demographics of crowd
  2. Ticket costs
  3. Impact of opposing team

###Group Work

In interviewing us, students should determine answers to some of the questions covered in the morning session, including:
 - What specific problem should be solved by the model?
 - What specific questions should the model answer?
They should propose answers to the questions:
 - How do we want to visualize the results?
 - What data sets will be used by the model? What characteristics will the model have? (linear? static vs. dynamic? deterministic vs. stochastic?)
 - How do we validate the model?

Then they will write pseudocode to solve the problem theyâ€™ve identified. They should be very specific about what data the model will use, the impact of uncertainty in input on uncertainty in output, expected accuracy, problems they anticipate needing to resolve (and resolutions, if known).

####OLDER

- Students write new code to determine the best travel schedule for Ghana
- Students use skills developed in SEAMS up to this point
- Improve capacity to model math

Students have written then corrected and improved each other's code.  Now they'll write something (simple) and new to optimize wins/minimize cost/achieve specific goal in response to specific weights on traveling schedule.
