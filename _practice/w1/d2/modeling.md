- Students write new code to determine the best travel schedule for Ghana
- Students use skills developed in SEAMS up to this point
- Improve capacity to model math

Students have written then corrected and improved each other's code.  Now they'll write something (simple) and new to optimize wins/minimize cost/achieve specific goal in response to specific weights on traveling schedule.
