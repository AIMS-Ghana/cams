title: Prepping Workspace for Football Exercises
---

In this exercise, we will apply ideas from the morning discussing to setting up a workspace.  Particularly, we will create workspaces for the rest of the afternoon exercises by:

1. creating places for them in the filesystem,
2. creating repositories for each of them,
3. attaching the repositories to the filesystem, and
4. stubbing out files / templates for those exercises



## Rough Outline for Long Exercise

 - select tools for the job: based on problem, skill set, goals - ensure those
 tools are available, configured correctly.  
 - set up repository
 - layout parts w/in filesystem/repo: folders/files for:
   * data
   * sources (partitioned by language, task)
   * testing work
   * top level scripts
   * any configuration items
   * intermediate results
   * plots / visualization
   * publication / lit items
 - select what to have in / out of repository
 - layout project tasks as issues
 - stub out code source files

Small group review focused on discussing:
 - what are the one-click / one-command items setup?
 - how does the organization support those? support portability? support
 working locally?
 - can other people look at the filesystem and "just get it"?
 - options for review: have people swap workstations, look at others organization for
 5 minutes, then try to explain it to group, and have actual owner explain any missed
 points.  from that, actual owner will have items to fix.  Also have people list a
 few items from other approaches that they wished they had done.
