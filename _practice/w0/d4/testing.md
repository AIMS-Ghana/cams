title: How to Verify and Validate Research Code as You Work

LONG EXERCISE STUB

For this exercise we would like you to use test driven development with PyUnit to create a program that can search a database of player statistics. You will need to:

 - Complie the data from a site such as: http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/252/Tournaments/2/Seasons/3853/Stages/7794/PlayerStatistics/England-Premier-League-2013-2014
into a useable, searchable database. (Your input will most likely be a long string of html code).
 - Write a program which can search this database across all parameters, and return as many results as fit the search criterion. For example, the user should be able to instantly find all players with number 10, or all players on Manchester united

You will work on this project in two groups: One team will write the "web-crawler" to convert online data to a useable database, and the other will write the code for the search program.

After writing the two programs separately the teams should exchange their codes and rigorously test the other team's work.
