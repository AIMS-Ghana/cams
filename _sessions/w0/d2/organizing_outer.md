## Opening Discussion

Why organize?  What's the benefit?  What's the cost?

## What is the point of organizing your workspace?

Few minutes discuss (other instructors pass out stuff for exercise),
few minutes organize, short time answer, few minutes discuss,
short reorganize, short re-answer (20 min total?)

 - exercise: physical artifacts (pictures / shapes?), folders
 - have people bin those artifacts into folders
 - pass their folder to another group, timed answering some question about
 the artifacts (e.g., number of squares, number of items w/ red face)
 - talk about what groups did to make other groups jobs easier
 - repeat: add more items

> organization should enable intuitive / obvious retrieval: improve probability of correctness, speed of retrieval organization improves time to *add* new material

## What does "organization" mean for computational research?

Few minutes discuss (archive should be pre-loaded on machines), few minutes organize,
few minutes shuffle + answer questions, short sample, few minutes reorganize,
repeat shuffle + answer new questions (20 min total?)

 - exercise: distribute disorganized archive, have people switch places and
 find something (alt: use some code snippet to find, display data?)
 - sample: 1 thing they liked, 1 thing they didn't like

> have opportunity to place things in filesystem, name them in a reasonable way position them to be used by code doing well: easy to find, use material

## How does scientific communication relate to organization?

 - exercise: write down recipe / directions, hand over to someone else
 - sample: instructors quiz on some recipe aspect (I want to make this for X people, how much Y do I need?)

> point of science is discover insight
> that insight must be independent of *you*, which means replicability
> the human component of replicability: must be communicated well to get people
> to *try* to replicate it, and organized well to enable them to do so

## How can organization provide (1) provenance, (2) flexibility, and (3) enable collaboration?

 - have people do some collaborative work, give them free reign on how to sharing
 - quiz on `git` commands
 - discussion on git ideas
 - exercise: using pre-establish repositories + groups (need user names in advance)
 have group members change things in set way, figure out which changes broke something,
 unwind things
 - requiz on `git` commands

> mostly about how organization enables collaboration by providing rules

## What is the value of templating?

 - exercise: set up RStudio project + package layout
 - alt: set up PyCharm project + module layout
 - have other people find something in project

> again, providing rules to the rescue: many different options, all roughly equal.
> pre-establised rules mean you (and your collaborators) don't have to figure out
> which option you want
