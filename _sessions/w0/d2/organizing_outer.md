Why organize?  What's the benefit?  What's the cost?  How do you organize?

## Why Organize Your Workspace?

> ### Exercise: Physical Organization
>
> Now that we have discussed some basic reasons to organize, we are handing out some supplies for a quick exercise.
> Your groups are receiving some envelopes, shape cutouts, and markers.
>
> Your first task is to organize those: *you have 2 minutes*.
>
> Now trade your result with another group, but do not do anything with their result yet:
> we will ask you a question momentarily, which the first group to answer correctly wins.
>
> *After that question*: How did you organize?  How did the other group organize?  What do you think was *bad* about your approach?  What was *good* about theirs?  Write down a few sentences answering these questions: *you have 2 minutes*.
>
> Now you will get more shapes.  Add those to the other group's material; you may also re-arrange their organization: *you have 1 minute, then trade*.
>
> Once everyone has their folders back, we will ask another question.  Again, the first group to answer correctly wins.
>
> After that question: What did the other group do?  Was that consistent with the organization scheme you used?  Why (or why not) do you think that?  Again, write your answers down: *you have 2 minutes*.

## What Does *Organization* Mean In Programming?

> ### Exercise: Computational Organization
>
> Download and unpack [this file]({{ page.thing }}disorganized.tgz).
>
> This collection of files is a mess.  It was used to generate the assignment of shapes
> in the previous exercise.
>
> With a partner, re-organize the files.  Spend 5 minutes.  Don't worry about making the code work (though feel free to do so if you have time).
>
> What do you change?  Why?  Write it down.
>
> Switch seats with another group, without discussing your changes.  What did they change?  Why do you think they did?  Spend 2 minutes.
>
> Now share your changes and reasons with the other group.  What did you like about the other group's approach?  What did they find *confusing* about yours?  Spend 2 minutes.

## Does Organization Relate to *Scientific Communication*?

> ### Exercise: Publication Requirements
>
> With a partner (that you have *NOT* worked with on the previous two exercises), take a look at the [New England Journal of Medicine](http://www.nejm.org/page/author-center/manuscript-submission) manuscript requirements.
>
> What do they actually require?  In 2 minutes: write down 2 distinct requirements.
>
> How does it relate to how you organize your project?  Write something (possibly "It doesn't not") for each of the requirements you identified previously.
>
> We will then discuss these answers as group.
>
> Which of your requirements (and their relations to organization) did other groups mention?

## Tools For Organization: Version Control

First a quiz on `git` commands.

> ### Exercise: `git` practice.
>
>
>
> have people swap workstations, draw task from a hat, switch computers, perform task, switch back and figure out what other person's task was
 - requiz on `git` commands

## Tools For Organization: Templating

> ### Exercise: Template a library
>
> We are now going to build the skeleton of a project that we could distribute for others to use.  Depending on which language you prefer, see either:
>
>  - [Python Modern](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/modern-package-template)

 - exercise: set up RStudio project + package layout
 - alt: set up PyCharm project + module layout
 - have other people find something in project

> again, providing rules to the rescue: many different options, all roughly equal.
> pre-establised rules mean you (and your collaborators) don't have to figure out
> which option you want
