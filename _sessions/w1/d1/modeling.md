## Choosing the Right Model

### General Questions

 1. What specific problem should be solved by the model?
 2. What specific questions should the model answer?  (How do we want to visualize the results?)
 3. What data set(s) will be used by the model?

### Characteristics?

 4. Is it linear?
 5. Static or dynamic?
 6. Discrete or continuous?
 7. Deterministic or stochastic?

### Evaluation?

 8. How stable is the model? (Is the result reproducible)
 9. How does uncertainty in input affect the output?  
 10. How do we validate the model?
 11. Is the mathematics used to model clear, concise, and understandable?

### Agent Based Models (ABM's)

 12. What is an ABM?
 13. What does it model well?  What does it model poorly?
 14. What would you use an ABM for?

### Slightly longer Exercise:

Recall the [Agent Based Model of Racial Segregation in NYC](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/introduction-to-agentbased-models-an-implementation-of-schelling-model-in-python/144)

TODO: propose simple, sensible model world extensions

Where does the code need to change?  Is there an "obvious" or "natural" place for these sort of extensions?
