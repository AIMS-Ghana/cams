Please answer the following questions, with short replies:

 1. The workshop intended to develop your ability to apply good programming practices to your research work.  Outline what you learned about applying this approach, and what you think you still to need practice.

 2. We covered defining a project.  Outline the steps you used to define your research programming project.

 3. We covered organizing your workspace.  What are some concerns you considered when you set up a workspace to do your project?

 4. We covered organizing your code.  What are some best practices you applied in preparing your code?

 5. We covered testing your code.  What is the point of testing your code?  Provide an example of how you tested your project work.

 6. We covered handling input and output. What kind of interface does your project work have? What are the inputs and outputs?

 7. We covered modeling in code.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of agent based models compared to more traditional mathematical models (*e.g.*, ODE models)?

 8. We covered how to think about the theoretical performance of your code. What are some of the methods we discussed (Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Reduction, Parallelization, etc.) that you used in your project?  Describe how you applied one.

 9. We covered how to think about particular performance bottlenecks in your code. In your project, what is a potential bottleneck?  How would you determine if it is?

Finally, what is the repository for your project work?  Do you plan to continue to work the project?
