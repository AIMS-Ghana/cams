Git Bingo

give out "bingo" cards, which give (loose) descriptions of git actions, then call out
git commands to play bingo.  have students fill out cards, and then when they bingo,
have them say which descriptions match which commands.

emphasize point ahead of time that they are not expected to know answers, but
rather to do best guesses.
