title: How We Evaluate Applicants
---

We evaluate potential participants by points.  People with the highest points are invited, down to the level where we have enough participants and there are ties.  For ties, preference is given to people with timely submissions of all parts of their applications.  After that, we decide subjectively.

We score on a three point scale (0, 1, 2) each of the following elements:

 - Interest in the course / potential to benefit from the course: 0 points for some one at too early or too late a level to benefit from being a course participant (*e.g.*, someone with none of the background that the AIMS program provides would not be ready to take advantage of the course, and someone at the level of the lead instructors is too advanced to benefit from the course).  1 point for someone able to benefit and expresses a sincere desire to do so.  2 points for applicants with a specific plan that would benefit from additional software skill development (*e.g.*, applications to further research training, plans for a startup enterprise, interviews for jobs or government postings that rely on technical training).
 - Computational skills:  0 points for limited skills or if skills are unable to be assessed.  1 point for basic skills (*e.g.*, being able to pass the AIMS computing module).  2 points for more general programming skill, knowing several languages, *etc*.
 - Project Proposal: 0 points for a project proposal that is either non-existent or unable to be evaluated.  1 point for a proposal for a general description of a scientific question that could benefit from careful workshopping.  2 points when that question has a specific description of work to be accomplished.

Additionally, current or former AIMS students, from any center, have 1 point added to their scores.
