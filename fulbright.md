## Prompt 2 (based on order provided):

> Project/workshop purpose (2,500 characters): project objectives, background on issues, essence of workshop

The *Software Engineering for Applied Mathematics and Sciences (SEAMS)* workshop
will provide expert coaching for some of the best African mathematics students,
so that those students can take their research projects to the next level,
while also gaining experience in the practices and tools used by effective
international technical collaborations tackling complex challenges.

The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) is a pan-African
organization, with affiliate sites in several nations, including Ghana.  AIMS
Ghana, like the other AIMS sites, focuses on developing the mathematical talent
of promising African men and women via a collaboration of African researchers,
students, and volunteer faculty from prominent institutions world-wide,
including many in the US.  This is accomplished via our accelerated Masters
program, which includes a few months of foundational coursework, followed by a
few months of intensive electives, and finally a few months of student-driven
research which is ultimately evaluated in a thesis defense.

The focus for AIMS program goes beyond producing world-class researchers:
we seek to develop people who will apply their mathematical talents to the
challenges facing Africa today.  This emphasis on applications of mathematical
thinking - whether driving African advancement in the academy, public
service, or private development - often lends itself to computational
approaches.

Given that, the program of study across all AIMS sites includes multiple courses
on programming.  When the students begin their thesis study, many of the
projects involve at least some computational work, and some involve a
substantial amount of programming.  For students that find themselves drawn into
more computational work - *e.g.*, modeling of large, complex public health
challenges such as Ebola - this basic coursework and initial research form a
solid foundation, and ideally positions them to take advantage of additional
mentorship, but the core AIMS curriculum does not leverage this opportunity.

We would like to address this gap by piloting an optional workshop focused
translating the student's research into high-quality programming products.  The
translation work will be tailored to the student projects, but we expect that
it will lead to publishable products, either in academic settings or as open
source tools on the world wide web.  This translation work will also provide an
opportunity for students to obtain expert training on the practices and tools
used in complex research software projects, preparing them to work in the international
collaborations in academia (e.g., groups like the ATLAS experiment, or the Human Genome project)
or industry (e.g., big data technology companies like Google).

TODO: note about particular tailoring to African setting?

## Prompt 1 (based on order provided):

> Project/workshop description (2,500 characters): type and scope of work that specialists would engage in (specific activities they would be doing, the extent and level of activities and who activities would benefit)

The workshop is intended to introduce students to the issues particular to research
software, some perspectives, best practices, and tools to overcome those issues, as well as
to provide an opportunity to apply those to their thesis work with coaching
from expert mentors.

We are requesting specialists that can perform the following:

 - prepare and lead classroom discussions of several general topics for research software, including
 short and long-form practical exercises to accompany those sessions.  Example
 topics would include how to organize analysis pipelines, tradeoffs for various
 data management options, developing test suites to verify and validate research
 code, how to incorporate others research work and how to distribute their own
 work, among others.  The prepared materials should also be organized into an
 open-source, globally accessible repository, for reference to the students and
 other potential workshops
 - review student projects leading up to the workshop to prepare appropriate
 focus sessions.  Example focus topics might include using numerical methods libraries for
 partial differential equations in various languages, integrating with geographic information systems,
 bioinformatics tools, among others.
 - work with local senior personnel to integrate them into the workshop program, with the goal
 of developing local expertise that can be called on throughout the AIMS semester,
 as well as someone that understands the program and can help coordinate it longer
 term.
 - where warranted, continue to collaborate with students after the workshop to
 move projects to published products, or coordinate introductions between the
 students and other collaborates interested in that translation work

The principle beneficiaries of this work are the students themselves, by improving
their skillsets and in some cases adding their work to the body of global research
knowledge and tools.  The local senior personnel and specialists will also likely
improve their skills as part of the workshop, and may be listed as co-authors on
student publications.  Finally, the AIMS organization expects to benefit from
the reputation that accrues from having students publish high-quality, complex
technical work and from having the workshop as an incentive to attract the best
possible students and proposals from African researchers.

## Prompt 3:

> Workshop Impact on Host Institution (2,500 characters)

AIMS, like any research and training organization, prospers according to its
reputation.  That reputation is built by the accomplishments of the
individuals that participate in its program.  Thus, the more high-quality work
its students and researchers get out to the public in general, especially while
participating in AIMS-based activities, the better faculty, students, and
research proposals the institute will attract.

The mission of AIMS is to develop mathematical talent, not produce programmers.
However, important technical work often involves a substantial software component.
Some students will naturally gravitate to this kind of work, and AIMS will benefit
by helping those students get the best coaching and collaboration tailored to
cultivating their interests as computational scientists and mathematicians.
By adding an optional workshop to end of the formal curriculum, AIMS can best balance
encouraging this subset of the cohort and meeting the needs of the whole student
body.

Since the workshop is focused on translating research work, we anticipate that
at least a few projects will eventually lead to publicly available products - e.g.
software modules for open source languages such as R or Python, web-based applications
making the research accessible to policy-makers.  All of these products would
highlight AIMS as an organization that reflects the highest intellectual standards
with innovative research that is clearly communicated and easily replicable and extended,
devotion to broad advancement of the African continent, and as place where students
and researchers can develop meaningful talents.

Including this workshop makes AIMS a better partner to the African researchers that
propose student work, since they can expect that the research products will be
packaged in a more organized, portable, and robust form, ready to apply to their
other work or future endeavors.  It may also encourage more diverse proposals,
as researchers encounter products that they might not have necessarily linked
to mathematical research.

Given the expanding role of mathematical and computational components across
technical disciplines, this workshop will also improve AIM students'
competitiveness for working internationally, since they will be prepared to go
abroad and be immediately ready to engage with high profile, difficult work.

DRAFT IDEAS BELOW

It is not generally useful to isolate the mathematical or scientific work and
the software tasks, much like it is not desirable to completely separate field or laboratory
work from theoretical development.  Both sides are impoverished.

Some students will have a natural inclination towards this bridging work, and would benefit
from perspective.

Given the time available, the mission of AIMS, and the needs of different students relative to
their backgrounds and the projects they select, the formal coursework at AIMS covers
programming syntax and applications to specific problems, but does not specifically devote time to the complexities of integrating software into technical work.  This is the appropriate
balance: without that foundation and the practical experience to expose them to
real challenges of this kind of work

## Prompt 4:

> Project Potential for Institutional Linkages (2,500 characters): for developing linkages between AIMS-Ghana and grantee's home institution....can be plans to expand and build on; new projects, mutual exchange of students/faculty; future collaborations on publications, etc between the institutions...

We anticipate the specialists will naturally be enthusiastic about the research
that our students are doing, and fully support them working collaboratively
with the students, other AIMS faculty, and African researchers that submitted
the proposals to make that work into something that benefits Africa and the world.

Because of the specialists will be coming from US universities or industry, we
anticipate that they will be aware of mutually beneficial matches between our students
and their home institutions, and that the skills developed in this course will
help those potential collaborations whether realized locally or in person.

Because of the nature of our research proposal system - where we solicit projects
from researchers in Africa - we anticipate that the specialists may also end up
connecting long term with those people.



software engineering intrinsically about how to collaborate on complex problems.
even though we do not expect students to become professional software developers,
insight into what makes good scientific software make them aware of what to do to
be superb collaborators with people that have that skill set.  Better organization
of data, decisions about what data to collect, how to analyze that data, understanding
how some algorithm fits within a larger analysis - all of these can make the difference
between months, years, even indefinite delay of understanding and having results
that we can scientific confidence in
