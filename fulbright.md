## Prompt 2 (based on order provided):

> Project/workshop purpose (2,500 characters): project objectives, background on issues, essence of workshop

The *Software Engineering for Applied Mathematics and Sciences (SEAMS)* workshop
will provide expert coaching for some of the best African mathematics students,
so that those students can take their research projects to their next level, while
learning how to be effective team members in complex technical collaborations.

The African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) is a pan-African organization,
with affiliate sites in several nations, including Ghana.  AIMS Ghana, like the
other AIMS sites, focuses on developing the mathematical talent of promising African men and women
via a collaboration of African researchers, students, and volunteer faculty from prominent
institutions world-wide, including many in the US.  This is accomplished via their
accelerated Masters program, which includes a few months of foundational coursework,
followed by a few months of intensive electives, and finally a few months of student-driven
research which is ultimately evaluated in a thesis defense.

The focus for the program at AIMS goes beyond producing world-class researchers:
we seek to develop people who will apply their mathematical talents to the
challenges facing Africa today.  This emphasis on applications of mathematical
thinking - whether driving African advancement in the academy, public
service, or private business - often lends itself to computational-based
approaches.

Given that, the program of study across all AIMS sites includes multiple courses
on programming.  When the students begin their thesis study, many of the
projects involve at least some computational work, and some involve a
substantial amount of programming.  For students that find themselves drawn into
more computational work - *e.g.*, modeling of large, complex public health
challenges such as Ebola - this basic coursework and initial research form a
solid foundation, and ideally positions them to take advantage of additional
coaching, but currently AIMS Ghana is not positioned to leverage this opportunity.

This is what we are attempting to accomplish with the *SEAMS* workshop: to take those basic materials
and weave them together into a finished garment.

In addition to learning programming language
syntax and basic problem solving, they would also enormously benefit from mentorship
on how to effectively integrate programming into their work.  Especially given the important differences in the computational "ecosystem" in Africa compared to where
most software development instructional material is produced.

## Prompt 1 (based on order provided):

> Project/workshop description (2,500 characters): type and scope of work that specialists would engage in (specific activities they would be doing, the extent and level of activities and who activities would benefit)

The workshop is intended to introduce students to the issues particular to research
software, some perspectives and practices to overcome those issues, as well as
to provide an opportunity to apply those to their thesis work with coaching
from expert mentors.

- discussion of software engineering concerns, how they apply acutely in African
context
- particular engagement with the student projects: review of that work leading
up to workshop, tailored preparation of discussion sections
- preparation of open-source workshop materials - training discussions, practice
work - post-discussions, highlight questions people had, and the discussions surrounding
them
- coaching students through process of delivering a scientific software product

## Prompt 3:

> Workshop Impact on Host Institution (2,500 characters)

Since the workshop is focused on translating research work, we anticipate that
at least a few projects will eventually lead to publicly available products - e.g.
software modules for open source languages such as R or Python, web-based applications
making the research accessible to policy-makers.  All of these products would
highlight AIMS as an organization that reflects the highest intellectual standards,
devotion to broad advancement of the African continent, and as place where students
and researchers can develop meaningful talents.

- makes it a better partner to african researchers, improves its competitiveness
for working with international partners, prepares its members to go abroad and be
immediately ready to engage with high profile, difficult work.
- having the workshop as a regular (though optional, competitive) part of the
program might encourage more / more diverse research proposals

## Prompt 4:

> Project Potential for Institutional Linkages (2,500 characters): for developing linkages between AIMS-Ghana and grantee's home institution....can be plans to expand and build on; new projects, mutual exchange of students/faculty; future collaborations on publications, etc between the institutions...

software engineering intrinsically about how to collaborate on complex problems.
even though we do not expect students to become professional software developers,
insight into what makes good scientific software make them aware of what to do to
be superb collaborators with people that have that skill set.  Better organization
of data, decisions about what data to collect, how to analyze that data, understanding
how some algorithm fits within a larger analysis - all of these can make the difference
between months, years, even indefinite delay of understanding and having results
that we can scientific confidence in
