title: How to Define a Programming Project in Research
---

*No coding*

Form groups with only one student with a "well-curated project."  This student should guide and mentor the others, but also should be honest about how he would do the project differently after completing his research.  He is expected to create a new proposal based on his research.  He should also be open to feedback and constructive criticism.

Newer students will develop their research proposals in increasing depth (modeled after required reading).

1. General Questions
   * Why are you interested in this topic?
   * Why is this topic important?
   * What question do you plan to answer?
   * What information/data do you need? How will you obtain it?
   * How will you draw conclusions from that information?
2. Conduct an initial review of literature and more precisely define research problem.  What subproblems do you forsee arising?
3. Second Review of Literature 
   * Summarize the results of previous research to form a foundation on which to build your own research
   * Collect ideas on how to gather data
   * Investigate methods of data analysis

Initial work should be paper, then typed up (plaintext) as (at most) a draft outline for some sort of publication.  Students will present their research proposals at the end of the day.
