title: How to Define a Programming Project in Research
---

Form groups of groups.  Newer students will develop their research proposals in increasing depth.

1. General Questions
   * Why are you interested in this topic?
   * Why is this topic important?
   * What question do you plan to answer?
   * What information/data do you need? How will you obtain it?
   * What code have you written?  What code will you need to write?
   * How will you draw conclusions from your work?
2. Conduct an initial review of literature and more precisely define research problem.  What subproblems do you foresee arising?
3. Second Review of Literature 
   * Summarize the results of previous research to form a foundation on which to build your own research
   * Collect ideas on how to gather data
   * Investigate methods of data analysis

*Students who have completed some research already should be honest about how they would do their project differently with aftersight.  He is expected to create a new proposal based on his research and open to feedback and constructive criticism.*

*No coding.* Initial work should be handwritten, then typed up (plaintext) as (at most) a draft outline for some sort of publication.  Students will present their research proposals at the end of the day.
