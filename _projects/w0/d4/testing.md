title: How to Verify and Validate Research Code as You Work

Assess how effective code is.  Specifically:
~Edge Cases
~Unexpected inputs (i.e. prob>1, prob<0)
~Actual results (comparison)
~Error stats
~Proper use of exceptions

Two tasks: (1) Have students assess and correct provided code.  (2) Students have already created code which performs specific tasks.  We'll ask them to test the quality of this code by testing edge cases (e.g. Manchester United defeats Ghana) and comparing to (newly provided) data.
