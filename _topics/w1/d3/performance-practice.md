title: Performance, in Practice
---

##Opening Discussion Topics:

 - What is an algorithm?
 - What is optimization? Types of optimization?  (Computational steps v. Memory usage)
 - Why optimize?
 - Why not always optimize?
 - When do you *need* to optimize?
 - Is optimization always possible?

##Review

 - Big O analysis
 - motivating example: Search techniques

##Techniques I

 - Theoretically identifying "hotspots"
 - Empirically Identifying "hotspots"
 - optimizing whole process v. Code "chunks"

##Techniques II

 - estimation as optimization (what are your projects specific needs?)
 - probabilistic techniques (math examples, e.g. IsPrime())
 - Some deterministic optimization techniques (e.g. Numerical matrix methods, matlab Magic)
 - Language dependent optimization techniques, low versus high level languages
 - Hardware dependent techniques, using all your resources.
 - Parallel v. Serial

##Has optimization worked?

 - Empirical testing
 - If probabalistic methods used, is program correct for large enough class of inputs?

##Review Excercises
 - Exchange and optimize
 - independent small research projects/ presentations on commonly used algorithms

When to optimize (later), when not to optimize (initially).

How to theoretically identify hotspots - big-O analysis.

How to empirically determine out hotspots - performance testing.

Learning about the details of a language and how that's relevant to optimization.

When do you *need* to optimize?

When does optimization actually work?  E.g., parallel vs. serial approaches in
different settings / at different problem scales.

Optimization of whole inputs-into-results process vs. optimization of a code
chunk.
