title: Optimization - When, Where, How
---

When to optimize (later), when not to optimize (initially).

How to theoretically identify hotspots - big-O analysis.

How to empirically determine out hotspots - performance testing.

Learning about the details of a language and how that's relevant to optimization.

When do you *need* to optimize?

When does optimization actually work?  E.g., parallel vs. serial approaches in
different settings / at different problem scales.

Optimization of whole inputs-into-results process vs. optimization of a code
chunk.
