##Simulation and Modeling
#### Linear Algebra
- Solving Systems of Linear Equations
- Matrix Factorizations
- Linearizing ODE/PDE's
- Combinatorics/Adjacency Matrices
- Image Compression (Bases)
- Modeling Physical Phenomena Discetely

Data Preparation/Interface

Type (Stochastic vs. deterministic, continuous vs. discrete, etc.)

Visualization of Data, Results

Examples – differential equations, stochastic processes, statistical predictions, 

Verification and validation of code → Reliability

Reproducability of Results

Error (Sensivity analysis) – impact of uncertainty in input on output
 
- How to have choices made in the code communicate what *you*, scientist, are
thinking.

- This discussion should pull together several threads from the various topics.
