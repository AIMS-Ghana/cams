Simulation and Modeling
Data Preparation/Interface
Type (Stochastic vs. deterministic, continuous vs. discrete, etc.)
Visualization of Data, Results
Examples – differential equations, stochastic processes, statistical predictions, 
Verification and validation of code → Reliability
Reproducability of Results
Error (Sensivity analysis) – impact of uncertainty in input on output

How to have choices made in the code communicate what *you*, scientist, are
thinking.

This discussion should pull together several threads from the various topics.
