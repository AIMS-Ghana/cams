title: How to Verify and Validate Research Code as You Work
---

Testing vs validation vs debugging.

Testing as a way to translate "this code does..." into formal description.  Thinking
with the end product in mind.

Debugging approaches.  Particularly, using IDE in browse mode.

Validating inputs - again, as a way of describe what code does.  Validation can
be thought of as documenting input parameters for a function.

How to have testing code integrated in source and not interfere w/ running.

All this in research setting, when outcomes often not explicitly specified.  How
to do testing given stochastic components.
