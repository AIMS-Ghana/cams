title: How to Verify and Validate Research Code as You Work
---


##Warmup discussion:

 - Validation v. Verification
 - How to test "correctness."
 - Why allow user error v. Writing highly detailed API? 

##Testing:

##Before you compile:
 - Documentation within code
 - Debugging with IDE
 - Throwing exceptions
 - Testing by hand
 - Incorporating test code 
 - Testing for codes involving random variables (e.g. Dependency injection, delegation)

##After Compiling
 - Edge Cases
 - Devising Tests

Testing vs validation vs debugging.

Testing as a way to translate "this code does..." into formal description.  Thinking
with the end product in mind.

Debugging approaches.  Particularly, using IDE in browse mode.

Validating inputs - again, as a way of describe what code does.  Validation can
be thought of as documenting input parameters for a function.

How to have testing code integrated in source and not interfere w/ running.

All this in research setting, when outcomes often not explicitly specified.  How
to do testing given stochastic components.
