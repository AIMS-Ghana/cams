title: Organizing inside Your Source - Best Practices, Separation of Concerns

organizing by way of syntax choices: capitalization vs CamelCase vs pothole_case,
indentation, arrangement of function arguments, etc.

Value of making these choices consistently: like reading a well-written book.
Authors may each have different voice, but their story-telling style (word choice,
construction, etc) is consistent within a book, often across their work.

Organization by class structure - what to make a class, what to not make a class.
Using functions to make work intellectually bite-sized.  Approaching organization
in a way that minimizes how much you have to worry about at once.

Regular refactoring: not just for optimization, but for organization.
