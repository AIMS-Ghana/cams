##Part 1: Research and the Research Problem

Students Review [this link which will be replaced by the pdf emailed to Carl](https://www.nyu.edu/classes/bkg/methods/010072.pdf).  This is from *Your Research Project: Designing and Planning Your Work* by Nicholas Walliman.  An alternate version is available through his publisher, Sage, but I don't like it as much.

#####VERY OLD

*Ask good questions! Translate your researchers' questions into questions you can answer and they want answered.*
1.  Initially research questions do not have "obvious" solutions. Requirements in a scientific setting...
2.  SCOPE, REQUIRED INTERFACES: Also deal with questions of what scope to address -- namely, what parts does your
code do explicitly, what parts do you with system tools or libraries.
3.  What will the code be used for? Deal with addressing different parts of project with different tools (e.g.,
munging raw data w/ Python, doing simulation in C++, visualizing output with R).
Talk about thinking in terms of pipeline.
4.  Publication? "Publication" programming - having an approach that you can describe in a publication
that someone else can review / publish.
