title: How to Define a Programming Project in Research
---

Roughly about how to do requirements in a scientific context, given that initially
research questions do not have "obvious" solutions.

Also deal with questions of what scope to address -- namely, what parts does your
code do explicitly, what parts do you with system tools or libraries.

Deal with addressing different parts of project with different tools (e.g.,
munging raw data w/ Python, doing simulation in C++, visualizing output with R).
Talk about thinking in terms of pipeline.

"Publication" programming - having an approach that you can describe in a publication
that someone else can review / publish.
