title: Workshop Overview
---

Welcome to the *Computation in Applied Mathematical Sciences* (*CAMS* for short)
workshop. *CAMS* is made possible by a partnership between
[AIMS Ghana]({{site.aimsghurl}}) and the US Office of Naval Research, Global Division.

During the workshop, participants will develop or apply mathematical scientific
research using computational tools.  That work will be guided by a curriculum
covering vital skills for research programming, with coaching by experts on
software-intensive science.

At the end of the workshop, individuals or small groups will demonstrate their
work. The mentors and participants will also discuss opportunities for longer
term collaboration, with publication of research products either in the
scientific literature or as open source tools for the benefit of Africa and the
world.
