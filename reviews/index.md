title: Language Reviews, Overview
---

During *CAMS*, we focus on *what* you write (*e.g.*, architecture, design, engineering), not *how* you do so (*e.g.*, syntax, coding, programming).

However, before you can write something interesting, you must know how to write at all.  The workshop assumes some programming background, but we will run through a (non-exhaustive) review.  During the rest of the workshop, you will likely see some syntax you do not initially understand: that's fine *as long as you seek help to understand it*.  Research the confusing code in some manner: try it out, check the documentation, Google, ask your fellow participants, ask the instructors (in that order).

Throughout the reviews, we have several "quizzes".  You should complete them first on paper, but after that you may check with the appropriate coding tool.  We will discuss the quizzes in class.  We will **not** be grading you: you should score the quizzes for **yourself** so that **you** can know what you **do** and **do not** know.  This is a powerful learning technique: **TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT**.
